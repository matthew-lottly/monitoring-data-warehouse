# Monitoring Data Warehouse

Database-engineering project for modeling, building, and validating a monitoring warehouse from operational station data.

![Warehouse preview](assets/warehouse-preview.svg)

## Snapshot

- Lane: Database engineering
- Domain: Environmental monitoring
- Stack: DuckDB, SQL, Python
- Includes: dimensional model, fact table, alert mart, quality checks, tests

## Overview

This project represents the database-engineering lane of the portfolio. It starts from raw station observations, builds a small warehouse model with dimensions and facts, and runs validation queries that are closer to platform engineering than notebook analysis.

## What It Demonstrates

- Warehouse-style schema design
- Dimension and fact table modeling
- Repeatable SQL execution against DuckDB
- Data quality checks for operational datasets
- A portfolio lane focused on database structure and reliability

## Why This Project Exists

Warehouse work is often hard to show publicly because the most valuable parts are schema choices, transformation discipline, and data quality controls. This repository isolates those concerns in a small, reviewable build.

## Warehouse Model

- `dim_station`
- `dim_station_attribute_history`
- `dim_region`
- `dim_category`
- `fact_observation`
- `mart_alert_station_daily`
- `mart_region_status_daily`

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
python -m monitoring_data_warehouse.builder
```

## Why It Is Useful In A Portfolio

- Shows dimensional modeling instead of only application code
- Demonstrates transform execution and validation from raw data to marts
- Gives a reviewer a clear database-engineering example that is separate from analytics and API work

## Outputs

- A local DuckDB warehouse file
- Row-count and quality-check summary
- A slowly changing dimension example for station ownership and response tier
- Sample daily alert and regional status marts

## Next Steps

- Add dbt-style dependency metadata
- Add partitioning and retention strategy notes for PostgreSQL migration
- Add source freshness and late-arriving dimension handling notes
